# M11.2 Lab My Simple Inventory

## Overview

 The goal of this project is to simulate a full stack web development environment with assistance from AWS through the creation of a Simple Inventory App.
 
 The app will use a combination of HTML, JavaScript and CSS to create a user interface that allows the creation and modification of items an inventory table.

## Compile and Run
To use this app you must have VSCode with the Live Preview extension installed. When You run VsCode you need to click on the box with the magnifying glass in the top right. You can then view and interact with the web page by entering the values specified in the Add New Item to Database box then clicking the Add Item button. Then Load can be used to pull the items off AWS and display them in the table. Delete can then be used to delete rows from the table.
